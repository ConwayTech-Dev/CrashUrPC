  <h3 id="risks">Run this at your own risk. Even though this program doesn't permanently damage your computer, it could really annoy your friend or delete unsaved work. I am not responsible for such things.</h3>
  <p>Click <a href="windowCrash.html">here</a> to initiate CrashUrPC using WindowCrash.</p>
  <p>Click <a href="componentCrash.html">here</a> to initiate CrashUrPC using componentCrash (only crashes your browser).</p>

  <h1>How It Works</h1>
  CrashUrPC opens over 1K+ windows and 1K+ tabs, some with the URL of about:blank and some with the URL of the "Crash Page". This overloads the RAM on your computer. For maximum CrashUrPCing, use Chrome.
