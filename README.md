# CrashUrPC

A simple HTML program to quite literally crash your PC. Not efficient... don't comment. :)

# Crashes

There are two "crash methods" used here.
The first is windowCrash, which opens *many* <code>about:blank</code> windows on a browser along with opening MORE CrashUrPC windows that do the same thing. It's designed to crash your PC.
The second is componentCrash, which simply overloads the computer with some simple HTML. Look at my code to learn more. Unfortunately, this generally only crashes your browser.
